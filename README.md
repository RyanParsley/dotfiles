# A fresh start (sort of)

In an effort to simplify my dotfile game, I've moved to a stow based approach. Clone this repo into ~/.dotfiles and run `stow .` to create some symlinks in the home directory to these file. You'll need to install stow (`brew install stow`) and remove any files in the home directory that you want to be replaced with symlinks manually.
